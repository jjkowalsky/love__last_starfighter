This was a school project to help us learn about scripting languages (lua) 
in a fun way.  We implemented a basic space invaders style game with some
added personal touches to slightly change the gameplay and add some elements 
of the classic movie "The Last Starfighter".  In the assignment description 
you can find the tutorial on which this game is based.  Hope you enjoy!
